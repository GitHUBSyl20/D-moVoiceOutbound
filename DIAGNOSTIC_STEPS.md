# üîç Vercel Diagnostic Steps

## Current Hypothesis:
**Most Likely Issue #1**: Vercel doesn't serve `/public` folder automatically for serverless projects  
**Most Likely Issue #2**: Rewrite to `/public/$1` doesn't resolve correctly in Vercel's environment

## üìã Steps to Validate:

### 1. Deploy the current changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add diagnostic endpoints for Vercel debugging"
git push origin master
```

### 2. Test these diagnostic URLs (replace YOUR-APP with your Vercel URL):

#### Test A: Check if API works
```
https://YOUR-APP.vercel.app/api/debug
```
**Expected**: JSON with file system information  
**This validates**: API functions work, shows where files are located

#### Test B: Try to access index.html via API
```
https://YOUR-APP.vercel.app/test-root
```
**Expected**: Either shows your HTML or 404 with paths  
**This validates**: Whether public folder is accessible from serverless functions

#### Test C: Try direct access to root
```
https://YOUR-APP.vercel.app/
```
**Expected**: Currently fails with "Cannot GET /"  
**This validates**: Root rewrite isn't working

#### Test D: Try accessing static file directly
```
https://YOUR-APP.vercel.app/public/index.html
```
**Expected**: Might work if public folder is served  
**This validates**: If Vercel can serve public folder at all

### 3. Check Vercel Build Logs
In Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí View Build Logs

Look for:
- ‚úÖ "Build Completed"
- üîç What files are in the output directory
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Any warnings about static files or rewrites

### 4. Share Results
Based on the diagnostic URLs above, we'll know:
- If public folder exists in the deployed environment
- Where files are actually located
- Whether rewrites work at all
- If we need to restructure the project

## üéØ Next Steps After Diagnostics:
Once we see the results, we'll implement one of these fixes:
1. Move `index.html` and static files to root
2. Use a different Vercel configuration approach
3. Create a catch-all API route to serve static files
4. Adjust the public directory configuration
